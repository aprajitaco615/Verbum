# Verbum
A word guessing game that helps you hone your vocabulary  
## Verbum Key Features  
###  Persistent Data Storage  
* Uses MySQL to store user profiles, including usernames, total plays, wins, and high scores.  
###  Automated Word Bank  
 * Automatically generates a comprehensive database of 6-letter words and their meanings using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library.  
###  Core Gameplay Mechanics  
 * Standard word-guessing logic with a limit of 6 attempts allowed per round.  
###  Visual Feedback  
 * Provides colored feedback for each letter to indicate if it is in the correct position, wrong position, or not in the word.  
###  Input Validation  
 * Robust checking system to ensure word length is correct, the word exists in the dictionary, and to prevent repeated guesses.  
###  Dynamic Scoring System  
 * Calculates scores based on the number of attempts taken and updates the user's high score in the database automatically.  
###  Educational Integration  
 * Displays the definition/meaning of the secret word at the end of each round to aid in vocabulary building.  
###  Session Management  
 * Offers a seamless experience allowing users to choose between playing another round or quitting the application.  
###  Self-Initializing Setup  
 * Includes a first-time setup process that automatically builds the necessary database and local word files on the first run.
